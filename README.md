# flutter_agc_mockup_4_f23

The main changes in this version are:

* Reorganization of the lib folder to conform to Andreas Bizzotto's [Riverpod Architecture](https://codewithandrea.com/articles/flutter-project-structure/)

## Installation

After downloading, cd into the directory and invoke:

```
flutter run
```

On my platform, that brings up the iOS simulator and the following:
